<div class="blurb">
<p>I've been doing technology education for a living since 1994. I even spent several years doing customer support for a "major midwestern University" , leading first a departmental, and then later college tech support group.</p>

<p>In that time I've earned two advanced degrees in Instructional Technology, and became a Professor at Towson University in the state of Maryland. I spent seven years as an instructional faculty member, seven years in the dean's office as an Assistant Dean, and since 2016, I am an instructional faculty member again.</p>

<P>I've seen a lot of stuff in my career. I saw a guy lose his entire collection of research images to an email virus, I helped deal with a student's possessions after they killed themselves, I helped the college and teacher education unit retain its national accreditation (without conditions). </p>

<P>I've dealt with students, faculty, administrators, wild raccoons, aggressive squirrels, and even once a deer. </p>

<P>I've been propped up, cut down, admonished, warned, praised, pilloried, and even once detested.</p>

<P>I think it is shameful how professional educators (teachers, professors, teacher educators, etc.) are misunderstood, and often denigrated. I think the root of that denigration is based on a lack of respect. And that lack of respect comes from a willful lack of understanding.</p>

<P>Maybe this blog can help address some of those misunderstandings, or at least suggest how some of them could be addressed, respectfully.</p>

<P>Thanks for stopping by! Indeed!</p>
