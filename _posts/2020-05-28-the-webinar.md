The World is experiencing a Pandemic, forcing teachers to teach in new, remote, online ways. Many of those teachers feel like they are underprepared for teaching in that kind of environment.

My program at Towson has developed an option to learn more about teaching and learning in a remote situation. Along the way, you will also earn a master's degree in Instructional Technology! Did I mention it is 100% online?

Come learn about the program. There is a webinar tonight!

Here's the information! Please share with others you know who might be interested:
