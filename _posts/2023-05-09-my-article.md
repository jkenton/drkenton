Recently, [I had an article published in Faculty Focus](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/if-i-missed-you-please-leave-a-note-in-the-chat/) about my experiences hosting weekly "hallway conversations" during the pandemic.

But don't take my word for it. Here is an automatically generated summary of the article by Readwise's "Ghostreader."

SUMMARY

A university professor started hosting weekly online "hallway conversations" during the pandemic to provide a space for informal chats with colleagues. However, the attendance was lower than expected, and the professor learned that informal conversation networks are usually discipline-specific and strongly localized. Despite this, the professor emphasizes the importance of staying connected with colleagues during challenging times.

As an aside, the summary is pretty good.

But, please don't take the Ghostreader's word for it, please have a read and let me know what you think.
