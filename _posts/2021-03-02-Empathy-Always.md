[*Ed: I'm grading some student work right now, and this passage affected me, so here I will share with you. I don't own the graphics, but the attributions of the quotes are right on them.*]


A few years ago, I was made aware of a "thought technology" that can nicely sum up what is happening these days: "Remember that everyone is having a tough time, so be kind" Other representations are "It's Chaos, Be Kind"Â

 And lastly, please remember the very wise words of Maya Angelou "People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."

 Somedays, your class will meets its SLOs, and somedays it won't. It's life!

Thanks!

So, please, dear reader... Remember that today you may encounter someone who is having the worst day of their life so far. Please know that their attitude toward you or others may be a result of that "worst day ever", and lend them some aid rather than scorn. <br />

I'm working on this too.
