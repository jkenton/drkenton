This week is the one devoted to professional development, focused on scholarship. The College lovingly calls it "Writing Bootcamp", and last year, they added "NVivo Bootcamp".


I love the chance to focus a few days' effort on learning some new things, or getting some focused work done.


This year, I'm trying to get my promotion binder completed. There is a lot of writing and reflection involved. So, the binder is kind of like a scholarly artifact of my most recent five years.

It's also a little scary.
