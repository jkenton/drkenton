It's Friday August 23. Monday is when the whole Fall semester kicks off.

I've finalized the syllabi for my classes. I've done my best with the Blackboard copy-course phenomenon.

There will be errors in continuity. People will call them out. I will fix them.

The Cycle of Academia.

Also, on Monday will begin a new chapter of my professional presence: Hailing effective uses of technology in learning scenarios, and calling out lower-order uses.

Should spark some discussion, or whatever. We'll see. This is the work.

Meanwhile, enjoy the respite!
