Welcome back to Towson University!

Fall 2021 is starting with a few challenges, but we are confident that all will go well, as long as people stay consistent with their policy compliance re: masks, vaccination, and testing.

Towson requires all folks who intend to attend campus events to provide evidence of vaccination. 

All folks who come to campus and enter any building on campus must wear a mask that covers ones mouth and nose while doing so.

Folks are expected to comply with testing requests, to assure that the campus community is protected from the COVID virus and its variants.

If you believe you have a health or religious rationale for non-compliance, please follow the guidance for those procedures here: https://www.towson.edu/coronavirus/vaccination/exemptions.html

Stay safe, everyone!
