8:00 AM

Last night, on Towson's campus, there was a shooting leaving three students injured. The reports this morning suggest that none of the victims' injuries are life-threatening, and that the event happened at 2 AM. Yet, the emergency messages didn't start until 2:46 AM:

```
TU TEXT TU Public Safety Alert Shots fired in area of Lecture Hall in center of campus. Due to police activity, please avoid the area.
```

and at 5 AM:

 ```

That message has a link in it:

```

Dear Towson University students, faculty and staff —

At approximately 2 a.m. on Saturday three people were shot while part of a group of people gathered in Freedom Square, a location in the academic part of TU’s campus. None of the injuries were life-threatening. 

Towson University's Office of Public Safety continues to work closely with Baltimore County Police as the investigation into this incident continues and the victims identified. 

At this time, the scene is secure; however, we're encouraging everyone, including all students, to remain away from the academic part of campus as police activity is ongoing. 

As more information unfolds, we will provide updates through Towson University Communications and social media. Please take a moment today to sign up for our [public safety text alert service](https://www.towson.edu/public-safety/police/emergency/text-alerts.html).

Staff through the Division of Student Affairs, Counseling Center and Residence Life is on campus and providing support for our students and community. Counseling and support services are available through the TU Counseling Center at 410-704-2512. 

Thank you for supporting one another during this most difficult time. 

Sincerely,

Kim Schatzel, Ph.D.

President

Vernon Hurte, Ph.D.

Vice President for Student Affairs

I know that 2 AM is not a time of hustle and bustle on campus. Yet, 45 minutes seems a long time to get an alert out on the campus' preferred alert system.

I have no way of knowing if the students in the nearby dorms were notified some other way, but 45 minutes on a Friday into Saturday. On a college campus?

It's been many years (seven to be exact) since I've been on Towson's campus at 2 AM. Yet, there was ALWAYS someone walking around then. It was weird, but not threatening. Then.

I don't even know what to suggest. Towson is a campus not far from a large city that has violence and drug problems (e.g. Baltimore; subjects of *The Wire* and *Homicide: Life on the Street*, among others). It's possible that some of that criminality leaked northward along York Road and found its temporary home on campus. Right now, I don't know.

I hope the campus finds a way to not get turned into an armed camp over this. Yes, there were gunshots. Yes, there were people injured. Yes, this scenario plays out often all along the York Road corridor from the city line all the way to the traffic circle just north of campus. Yet, I don't know if surrounding the campus with wrought iron (as some other institutions have done, including the Catholic church that was just a stone's throw away from my previous home in Towson) is an appropriate remedy. In such cases, I would wonder (like Robert Frost):

```
What I was walling in or walling out,  
And to whom I was like to give offense.
```

Anyhow, I am hopeful that:

* the victims recover quickly, and 
* Towson's response is measured, and 
* the Emergency Alert system is used more quickly in the future...
