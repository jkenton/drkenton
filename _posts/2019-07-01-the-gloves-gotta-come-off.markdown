I'm better at verbal rants, but here are some huge chunks of problems that I see with **public or general perceptions about technology**, *learning*, and students


* **There is too much belief in the "naked value" of Technology**
("Naked value" is my term for attributing an unwarranted value to something, in the absence of supporting data or evidence; Blind faith?)*It matters more* how *the technology is used, rather than* how much *technology is used*

* **Technology is not responsible for changes in Performance** (however, technology *can* be a very valuable tool for helping learners to learn) *at best, technology helps to mediate, or shepherd, or guide, or facilitate the conditions needed for learning to take place (in the learner's head)* *to learn effectively, learners need to be able to emulate effective models*

* **Learning does not take place in the Technology, rather in the individual** _technology is not the_ source _of Learning, perhaps, at best, the_ host _of learning_

* **Teaching for learning with technology is not same as merely teaching with technology** *The process of learning how to teach effectively with technology* **_starts_** *with being a great teacher, not as a result of using technology often, or consistently*
