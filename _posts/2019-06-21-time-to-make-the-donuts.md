As a younger man, I used to work what I call the wrap-around shift. Work until late, then wake up and start it all over again. Among my friends, the saying upon walking in the door was "Time to Make the Donuts".

I am a much older man now, and sometimes the wrap-around is necessary. You know, like when a big deadline is upon us and all the IOUs I wrote out of procrastination all come due at the same time.

So, enjoy some Americana from the early 1980s, on me. If you have a spare cup of "Dunkies", kindly send it this way.
