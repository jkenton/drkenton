I get asked regularly about my online course module deadlines.

The questions fall into two neat categories:
	*Why are your module dates between Wednesday and Tuesday?*
	*Why are some things due on Saturday, and others are due on Tuesday?*
	
This video answers the latter. Another video answers the former.
