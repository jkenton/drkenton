During the April to June timeframe, we had submitted our Institutional Report, and waited with baited breath as the review team looked at our materials.

In mid summer we got a preliminary report, which we could use to clarify some misunderstandings before the site time arrived on campus. What a time...

One of the instructors in my prior department was teaching a program called Voki to her students.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/y96522on">She created the Voki here </a> to recite the College's mission.
