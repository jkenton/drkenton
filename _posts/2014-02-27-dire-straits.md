I have been working on a huge project for a number of weeks now. The soundtrack - almost uninterrupted - for the last two weeks has been Dire Straits' greatest hits collection *Sultans of Swing*. And when I said uninterrupted, I mean it. On repeat in iTunes. NON-STOP. And unlike every other band's music, I have not gotten tired of it, or even considered turning it off, down, or finding something else to listen to.

Amazing.

Mark Knopfler might be my guy.
