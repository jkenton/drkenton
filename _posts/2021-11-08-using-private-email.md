Question: Hey Dr. Kenton, I don't like reading my Towson email account. It's a pain in the [Neck]. Is there any way that you can send course-related emails to my personal email address instead?

I can certainly relate to having multiple email accounts to check. BUUUUUT, there's a Policy:

### 10-03.00 – Electronic Mail Policy
**Policy Statement:**
All students, faculty and staff members are issued a Towson University (the “University”) e-mail address and must establish their University e-mail account. *This account must be used for any and all communication to and among students, faculty, and staff as well as departments, offices, and units on University matters or business.* It is the responsibility of each e-mail account holder to monitor e-mail on a regular basis. The University electronic mail users must abide by the guidelines in this policy and protect e-mail documents according to University and University System of Maryland (USM) policies, and Maryland State laws.

Using a Non-TU Email Account


If you are using a non-Towson University email account, you could be missing assignments, time-sensitive financial aid information or other important campus correspondence. To ensure receipt of TU emails, automatically forward them to your preferred account. See student email resources on the OTS Webmail Powered By Google webpage.
