During a recent class, the "professional students" started asking a lot of very detailed questions about the expectations of the final project in that class.

At a point, the minutiae were getting unnecessary. So I said "Just do."

*Puzzled looks...*

"Listen, what I want is for you to take some chances with this project. Do the thing that you WANT to do. Don't wait for me to give you permission, because my imagination isn't up to deciding whether your idea has merit or not. So just do."

And then I told them what I told my other class: "If you have another idea for [completing the project requirements], and I haven't included it above, let me give you carte blanche now: "That idea sounds amazing!! Either email me a link to your online hosted file, or attach it to the submission forÂ [Final Project]" In other words, if you can record it, and send me a copy of the recording OR email me a link to the [thing] that is hosted online, it's approved."

And still I got questions...

These folks have dealt with former instructors, who probably had some sort of vindictive vendetta going, making folks fear the grade-based retribution that comes from making mistakes (everyone makes mistakes). I have no interest in something so petty and nonsensical. [Full disclosure, I USED to be a lot more this way in the far past.] 

Here's the calculation: The project is specified, and I will grade it according to the rubric. I have no limiting factors about HOW the final project is presented. Only THAT it gets done. There is a lot of work required to cover all the necessary ground. That's enough anxiety. For both of us.

For the first seven years of my teaching career at this University, I offered openly that a creative performance would earn a guaranteed "A" on the final project. Sing a song, act a one-act play on the content, give a monologue, write and recite a short story (15 mins or less)... As long as the CONTENT was in there, I cared not a whit about the CONTEXT.

Only one brave soul took me up on it. Damn good song too. It was a cover of a Beatles song, with the lyrics changed to suit the course content. Very nice. But only one of hundreds...
