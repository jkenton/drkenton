The frustration now begins in earnest. That's right folks, <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/514196-battle-over-covid-19-school-openings-goes-to-the-courts">the lawsuits have started</a>. Some say that the decision makers didn't really have the right level of power. Others say that the response is disproportionate to the emergency. Others are upset that they are unable to return to their place of employment.

Yes, indeed, Americans have no shortage of disposable money to try to force other folks to do their will. And sometimes a shocking paucity of "sense" when it comes to truly dealing with a remarkable and literally worldwide *communicable disease*.

<ul>
<li>And despite all the opportunities to see that wne large groups of folks get together, there is another outbreak.</li>

<li>And despite the scientific evidence that says transmission is only truly stopped when interpersonal contact is absolutely limited.</li>

<li>And because there is an unproven hypothesis that children are immune.</li>

<li>And in spite of evidence that says many affected young folks have pretty substantial damage to their hearts and lungs as a result of infection.</li>
</ul>
Lots of Americans feel that the appropriate response is to open the public school buildings (involving lots of adults, namely teachers and staff).

I live in a state where the Governor decided that the infection rates in the state's counties were such that schools *could* reopen. Thing is, the school systems had already virtually unanimously decided to have remote instruction only during the Fall semester. I say virtually, because some counties are allowing small groups of volunteers into school buildings on assigned days.

The bottom line with this is that *nobody really knows* how COVID-19 will affect any given person. It may be a "nothing burger", or it may incapacitate a person, or kill them.

I really do not think the proper response is to say "GET BACK TO WORK EVERYONE!" Until there is a proven-effective vaccine (and there is work underway), stay the HELL AT HOME, or at the very least AWAY FROM ME AND MY FAMILY. And don't go about trying to force me to play along with your delusion.

I am very satisfied with my workplace's decision to do remote learning in the Fall, due to exceeding pre-determined thresholds for positive tests among students, faculty, and staff.

It may not be ideal, but it is based on Science and Reason.
