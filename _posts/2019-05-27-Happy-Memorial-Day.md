<div class="blurb">
<p>It does seem juxtapositional to wish someone a "Happy Memorial Day", given the reason for the holiday.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Memorial Day has become an informal marker to begin Summer, and is a reason for people to appreciate the sacrifices of others. I'm all in favor of expressing gratitude, and I believe gratitude is good.</p>

<p>I enjoy the feeling that Summer brings: People start to relax. There are fewer expectations on each other. There are vacations. There is swimming. People go outside willingly. All of those restorative things are also good.</p>

<p>Now, the reason we begin those things around the end of May is probably a little bit political. And the "start of Summer" jump-starts the season by about a month. (the "end of summer" also short-changes the season by about a month... so I guess there's equilibrium?) But, the Holiday is there to remind folks that there was a price to pay, and it was paid. The positive things that have accrued to us deserve to be acknowledged.</p>

<p>So, maybe the "Happy" part is acknowledging that I can have these happy things because of the suffering and loss of others. Not really saying that the day is happy. Just that the Day is a periodic reminder that the sacrifice has not been in vain. We are Happy (and Thank You!)!</p>
