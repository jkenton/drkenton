Need to keep marching. Forward. Forward. Forward.

So much going on. So. Much.

This project's last mile is putting my brain through some loops, and I am having a hard time with it.

Forward. Forward. Forward.

The work won't get done by itself, and I am the one to do it. So I need to keep marching.

So. Tired.
