A handful of months ago, a discussion started on campus related to the "ownership" of doctoral work. Does the work belong to the new doctor, or to the professor who sponsored it? I wrote this response to a request for my opinion.

>I believe the dissertation or other doctoral project is primarily the work of the student, and the advisor is largely doing the work of advising out of his/her “own hide”. Accordingly, the data and everything – from my point of view – belong to the student, and not the advisor. Does [the University] have a policy that says the dissertation must be written by the doctoral student him-/herself (i.e. can an advisor be a co-author on a dissertation)? If there is a policy that says the dissertation must be written by the student, then it is clear that the project belongs to the student.

>I have seen some cases where advisors either forced their name to the first position on every derivative work from the dissertation study, or just out and out  stole  the student's work and claimed it for him/herself.

>In every case where I saw an advisor requiring his/her name to be first on those publications, it has made that advisor look kind of selfish and foolish. In the case of the theft, that advisor had to issue a very public  **mea culpa**  and ask the journal to amend the official record to include the student's name among the authors.

>These advisors perpetrated an insult of the highest order to the student who JUST FINISHED.

>This thinking makes no sense to me.

>In almost every case where publication was involved, the new doctor has been very pleased to include the advisor's name as a co-author on any work that resulted from the study and its data.

>I have also seen instances where a new doctoral student had NO INTEREST in publishing their work, and the advisor wanted to make sure it was written up. In those cases, it was very clear that the project was abandoned by the student, and that the advisor is writing it up for the good of the field. In those cases, the advisor’s name goes first and the student's name goes second (in ALL cases, the student's name is at least included).

>As we know, the process of negotiating order of authorship is a highly personal thing, and not everyone acknowledges that advising dissertations is largely service, and not as much scholarship.

It may be out of a sense of altruism, but I truly believe that a doctoral student is someone to  *champion*, not  *exploit*.  Likewise, when a dissertation results in a handful of actual publications, the student should be the recipient of any benefits from that effort and service.

Far too often, advisors are not working from the standpoint of this  *mentoring*  relationship, and far more often out of a desire to have a  *beast of burden*  to further his/her publication record.

If one is to believe the maxim  [*stand on the shoulders of giants*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants),  sometimes one must understand that the beneficiary is the newly minted doctor, and not the advisor.
