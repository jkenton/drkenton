I've been feeling crummy the last couple of days, with an upper respiratory cough and some miserable muscle aches. Is it the Flu? Is it COVID? Is it ["Durchzug?"](https://www.thelocal.de/20190625/only-germans-believe-air-draughts-are-harmful-red-cross-advice-goes-viral/)

So, the above test is telling one version of the story.

I still feel like I've been run over by a bean bag chair, and my chest sat upon by a mildly overweight dog.

All my issues are ALWAYS sub-clinical...

Anyway, starting to hit the reading list (for fun!)
