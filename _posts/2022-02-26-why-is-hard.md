All right, I run up against a new kind of hesitation or what is the right word.

Blockage. I don't know. It's like I've identified This thing, a set of conditions that need to exist before I can do something one of my you know. Why am I blocking myself from finishing? What it is that I want to do especially with the resistance with respect to the hallway paper.

There's no reason why I shouldn't be completing it, but I think the in the late stages of the semester and spring of 21, I guess I got asked a question that I think probe down into the lowest-most point of my soul. Somebody asked me a very simple question. They asked, "Why did you host the hallway conversations?"

Meetings. And at the time it's seemed like the simplest. No, I did it because you know, and needed to be done, but then a number of other things. Recently have brought into relief the nature of how I've made a lot of decisions in my career. And in my life they boiled down to me.

Only seeing that something is important or that I value it or that I think that it's worth doing, but that I can't put a specific answer in the blank. Why, why did you get married? Why did you do a doctorate in educational technology when you're not interested in doing the design and development work to make the products that you yourself have found to be successful?

Why did you, why did you become a professor? Why did you fight so hard for tenure at an institution that has shown over? And again, that it doesn't have any respect or desire to value? Anybody particularly why did you want to stay? Why did you have the relationships you did in your life?

Why did you? And for some reason, I previous to handful of days ago, wouldn't have cared that. I didn't know why. I didn't that I didn't know why it would not have cared, but for some reason that question in the late spring of 2021, really knocked me off my pegs a little

That, you know, I why did I become the assistant dean. Why did I do X? Why did I do? Why, why did I do Z? Why did I move to Elkton? Why did I these are all things? Why did I agree to have Michael come live with us. Why did I agree to add three dogs to the equation?

Why did I? I don't know the answer to any of those questions.

And I don't know necessarily that I need to know the answer to all those questions but for some reason, it seems like For some reason it seems like I ought to and I don't know whose telling me that I ought to. It's not necessarily me. Where is it coming from?

Why does it matter? I'm doing it. I did what I did and I'm not, I am proud to say that I have done it. I am glad that it's done to have done it and I don't have any regrets about it.

But the fact that I don't know why. For some reason, it's sitting on me.

That's a little bothersome little bothersome.

And so maybe that's what's causing the hesitation that I feel like I need to figure out why and that, you know, that it seems bogus it seems bogus, but I need to know why I did something before. I can feel like the paper deserves to be written. That's seems bogus.

And yet, I think, I think it's sitting on me, I think it's sitting on me.

And I have accumulated all this all these things and stuff in my life that probably are preventing me from having to confront the fact that I don't know why I'd like to just lay it all at the at the feet of this one particular question, of course that's ridiculous that is a ridiculous attempt to lay everything at the feet of this one thing, I'm sure there's more rationality than that, but I think the thing that's preventing me from moving forward with this project is the fact that I don't know why.

I don't know why I'm doing it. I don't know why I'm not doing it. I don't know why I did it. I couldn't give a good reason. Why? It just seemed like it needed me done. That's all I can say. It needed to be done, somebody needed to do it.

I felt like I was the one who could do it, so I did do it. Nobody expected me to do it. Nobody expected me to do it. And yet, I did it for a year.

So, I mean, it's a little, it's a little confusing, a little confusing.

But I guess, recognizing

Recognizing that there's a hesitation.

It's very good for step.

Why, why did I do it? It's not anything. I've done is bad or not necessarily bad but it's unknown. Why?

Let's do it.

In each case seem like it was the right thing to do.

And then I was the one who could do it and so I did it.

So why did it become my responsibility to do it? Because I let it be, If I didn't do it, if I, you know, didn't didn't didn't serve as the assistant dean, they would have found somebody to do the accreditation stuff. They would have, maybe they would have done better just as good or not.

As good as me. But in the scheme of things, it didn't matter it. You know, somebody was going to do the work. Somebody was going to do the work.

It didn't have to be me.

Didn't have to be me.

But it was me. I let it be me and that's got to be okay. I mean, I got to be okay with that. Didn't have to be me but I let it be me and it's okay.

He didn't writing it down now, have to be me. I let it be me.

And that's okay. Now, with respect to the, it didn't have to be me. It may have been someone else.

And they may have.

Had a better similar or worse experience.

Then I did.

I let it be me because I thought it needed to be done and I wanted to be the one who did it.

For better or worse. But preferably better.

And that's okay.

That's the work needed to be done.

They work became.

A fungible task.

Anyone could have done it.

And maybe my feeling that I could do and given job better. It's the reason why I hesitate to do the things. I am asked to do.

Nobody.

Makes me bleed my own blood.

I only want to do the things I want to do, not the things. You want to do? That's pretty fucked up.

I'm going to scan that because I think I don't want to lose the paper.

Let me read it all in one chunk.

It didn't have to be me. I let it be me and that's okay. It didn't have to be me. It may have become someone else and they may have had a better similar or worse experience than I did. But I'd let it be me because I thought I needed it.

It needed to be done and I wanted to be the one who did it for better or worse. But preferably better, and that's okay because the work needed to be done. The work became a fungible task, anyone could have done it and maybe my feeling that I could do a given job, better is the reason why I hesitate to do the things that I'm asked to do above and beyond my normal work, nobody makes me bleed my own blood.

I only want to do the things, I want to do, not the things you want me to do. Did I just set myself free? That's a lot of powerful. Shit, right there, on that, one piece of paper.

All right. So what's the the paper I want to write the pay for? Because I want to tell the story about the thing that I did that I did not because somebody asked me to, but because I wanted to, I didn't do this because somebody asked me to I didn't because I wanted to and that's an important distinction for me to make from myself.

So how can I write the paper in a way that it's me telling a story about something that I wanted to do as opposed to me telling a story about something. Somebody else wished would get done and I picked it up and I did it.

How do I tell the story that way?

Because I don't want to tell a story about how somebody asked me to do extra work and I did extra work.

And when somebody asked me, why I did it, I can't answer them because I don't know why I did it because I wanted to do it and that has to be. Okay. I did it because I wanted to do it. I chose to do it every week. I made the choice.

Do I send the invitation message out or do I not. And every week I did whether somebody else arrived and showed up or not, I invited I was there. The room was open for people to participate if they wanted, wasn't some sort of quid pro quo, like I did it because somebody was going to give me a course, release.

Or because I had a particular, you know, agenda I wanted to push or whatever. It's because I want to do it because I wanted to do it.

How do I tell the story in a way where I'm telling a story about something? I wanted to do the turned out pretty good.

Instead of couching, in, in terms of I did it because I got permission to

Because that's not entirely. I don't know that I needed to get permission.

Because I'm a capable one. Goddamn it. Nobody asked me to do it. I offered to do it because I knew that I could because I'm the capable one.

All right, so why am I learning? Are why am I learning the R language? Why am I trying to learn SPSS? Is it because I'm trying to fill a need that. I identify in the department. Nobody asked me to do it. I'm doing it because I want to, I'm going to contact Menaz, and ask her to include me in that research group.

Let's look at AR and VR because it's something that is adjacent to something I care about. And I think that it's similar enough that I could make a useful contribution because I want to
