Let's start by saying that if you think empathy is a political issue, or a "touchy-feely" topic can save themselves a lot of effort and anguish by stopping here.

Still here? Great!

During the early days of the pandemic (Spring 2020), our Provost asked us to have Empathy for students who were dealing with hardships related to COVID-19. Sounded great then. So we extended deadlines and gave students the benefit of doubt. It worked out.

During the heat of the Pandemic (2020-2021 Academic year), we were asked to continue having Empathy for students affected by, or dealing with the consequences of, COVID-19 on themselves or their family members. 

The University seemed very motivated to try to offer the best possible learning experience using distance learning tools, training instructors to create better online learning environments, and more. And it seemed to work fine. Yes, it was not optimal, but it was working at least "OK" for many, many students.

Then vaccines and boosters became available and infection rates dropped. And fewer people needed ventilators. Now the CDC does not categorize COVID-19 the same way as it did - and the same request to extend empathetic responses to students are not heard so widely or broadly. 

In fact, the broad options to offer remote learning options have been constrained. That is, the aim seems to be to get students to return to campus.  It looks like my institution, as many others (most?) have decided that COVID-19 is now no different / more serious than flu. And flu is manageable without pushing folks to remote learning, and all that. So, business as usual? 

(I was never on a decision-making committee about this, and it was not my decision to make. Would I have things different? I would have advocated for remote options for students, where possible.)

Now that the CDC has removed mask guidance, or even requirements, the push in America is to "return to normal." 

Yet, now Long COVID needs to be mixed into the goulash. Yes, Long COVID is a thing. [The CDC has a page summarizing the range of symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html) of Long COVID, and the list has enough symptoms to require headings (General, Respiratory, Neurological, Digestive, and Other (as of Dec 16, 2022 update)).

Catching COVID was never a CHOICE (except for folks desiring to treat the illness as a stunt). As such, a person may want to acknowledge that *active* infection is bad, and *long-term* symptoms may be yet worse. So, these new long-term consequences also fall under the heading of "outside of one's control." And that is where the Empathy lives, isn't it?

Am I saying that we should shut everything down now, or for a longer time? No. Yet, more caution and variance may be useful or necessary. You know, because Empathy.

As I start the Spring 2023 semester this week, I want to remind my friends and colleagues that the default position for dealing with other people has always been "everyone is fighting a hard battle". In these days, please remember that the "hard battle" may include symptoms that cannot be seen or adequately expressed. Exercise more Empathy, rather than judgment. 

Of course, if you made it this far, you probably already felt that way. If so, just know I agree with you. And knowing that you've got a confederate is often enough to stand up to a lot of nonsense.

Have a great Spring 2023, everyone!
