# GETTING STARTED

There's no better time than the present to get started

The whole point of this blog is to try and identify which types of classroom technology uses are effective to help students learn better. There are lots of different ways that technology is used presently, and some of them are noted for being effective for learning. Most, however, are not.

My impression of classroom technology use is that most either enhances teacher productivity, or entertains the student. Any learning effects from these types of uses are ancillary, or perhaps even accidental.

I'm not entirely cynical. I know that there are effective classroom technology uses. I will highlight those here also. However, there is so much misdirection and doublespeak around the topic of educational technology used in the classroom that it frankly makes my career path look silly.

So, my intention is to release a daily statement, similar to this one, at least three times a week. I intend to write a slightly longer and more thoughtful peace at least once a week.

If you have a comment or an argument that you'd like to share with me please do so at jkenton@towson.edu

Otherwise let's get this thing started.
