'Tis the season for employment changes, and job applications, and reference letters. My message for today regards some etiquette for asking a professor for a reference letter or a background check, or whatever. I am writing this because I just received a request for a reference for a person I do not know or recall by that name. Just a couple points, because I know you are busy!

First, as much as possible, make the request personally. Email or a phone call might work. Face to face is better. In pandemic times, a Zoom call is good, too.

Second, make sure that the professor you want to ask  is willing to write a reference letter for you. Some folks will, some folks won't. A professor may be willing to write you a very truthful reference letter, which may not be productive for the job you are seeking.

> Hey Dr. Kenton, this is Alexander Sewandso. I was in your fundamentals class a couple years ago. I am curious if I can ask you to write me a reference letter for graduate program. You and I didn't always see eye-to-eye on every assignment, but I did well in your class and I respect your opinions.

The answer to this question is important. If it's no, move along to the next person on your list. But also clarify the rationale for a "yes" answer. Some folks will answer:

> Yes, Happy to.

Others will say:

> Yes. However,if they ask about your work ethic, I need to be honest about it. You were late arriving to class, and sometimes missed deadlines in my class.

Or, as indicative of the *worst ever reference letter I read*:

> Dave is a dedicated and diligent worker. His most major weakness is his inability to confront authority figures, or to openly address problems that are tearing his team apart.

Third, make sure that the professor recalls who YOU are, especially if there were a lot of folks in your classes with the same name, or if you always worked with one particular student. While I can write a generic letter, employers can spot them a mile away, and often they go unread (which is not helpful for your purpose). You might do this just by saying:

> Hey Dr. Kenton! This is Sylvia Hoozits. I graduated in 2008 from the program and took a few classes from you. At the time, my name was Sylvia Fudd. DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

> Hi, this is Tim Haughty, and I took your Learning Theories class a couple years ago. I did my final project on the use of shiny objects to gain young students' attention.

Fourth, in your request, give some insight into the type of work the desired job is going to provide you. A letter for a classroom teaching position will be very different from one for entrance to a doctoral program, or a parole board (that last one is for humor, only). I find that a reference letter that is addressed to an applicant's ability to do the specific job they are hoping to get, is better than a generic letter that just says how great you are and how well you work in teams.

> I'm applying for a position as an instructional designer. The scope of the job is managing a work team that is designing instructional materials for middle school children. As you may remember, before I completed the program, I was a 7th grade science teacher, and used your graduate program to change professions.

Lastly, please give a heads up to that professor that you are putting their name down so that they can be prepared when a request comes. No offense. As life goes on, people change their name. The reason why is unimportant. Also, if you haven't been in contact with someone for a while, they may have an even harder time remembering a name.

> Hey Dr. Kenton. Sylvia Hoozits again. I appreciate you writing me a letter last year. That job isn't working out. I want to use your name again for a job I am applying for with International Conglomerate, Inc.? If you agree to write me another letter, they will contact you within a few weeks.

So, to sum up: make sure that a professor is willing to write a letter. For you. That they are aware of who you are/were. And that they know a request is coming.

All of these tips are important to make sure that a request for information or help will actually be helpful to get you what you want.
