I may have reason sometimes to be snarky about how my institution handles moments of import. In this case, I admit I am proud. #TUStrong

**Motion 19/20-33:**  *In response to the recent announcement by Secretary of Education Betsy De Vos prohibiting universities from providing any federal emergency relief funds to support undocumented students (including DACA students) and many international students in need during the current public health and economic crisis, the TU Academic Senate expresses their unwavering support for* **all** *students.*

*As TU faculty, we care deeply about our students' mental and physical health and welfare.  We encourage contributions to the TU Foundation Student Emergency and Food Insecurity Fund, whose resources (unlike federal funds) can provide financial solace to any TU student in need, regardless of whether that student is a U.S. citizen or non-citizen, documented or not.*
